# Difinition of Convex set and Convex hull
### Convex set
A set of points in a Euclidean space is defined to be convex if it contains the line segments connecting each pair of its points
### Convex hull
The convex hull of a given set **X** may be defined as:
1.The (unique) minimal convex set containing **X**
2.The intersection of all convex sets containing **X**
3.The set of all convex combinations of points in **X**
4.The union of all simplices with vertices in **X**
